## 前端

### 1. Mac系统下的环境变量

`/etc/profile ` +  `/etc/paths` 是系统级别

加载顺序`~/.bash_profile` -> `~/.bash_login` -> `~/.profile`。如果存在一个则后面不加载。

`~/.bashrc` 它是bash shell打开的时候载入的。

### 安装 `Homebrew`

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
安装完终端会有提示
```shell
==> Next steps:
- Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
 echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/youzhenbei/.zprofile
 eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
- Run brew help to get started
- Further documentation:
 https://docs.brew.sh
```

### 安装`nvm`

`brew install nvm`

安装完终端会有提示
```shell
You should create NVM's working directory if it doesn't exist:
mkdir ~/.nvm
Add the following to ~/.zshrc or your desired shell
configuration file:
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
 [ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && . "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
 [ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && . "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" # This loads nvm bash_completion
You can set $NVM_DIR to any location, but leaving it unchanged from
/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm will destroy any nvm-installed Node installations
upon upgrade/reinstall.
Type nvm help for further information.
```
